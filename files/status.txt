Status of the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily
(Additional information on GHCNd is available in the readme.txt file.)

June 21, 2024
Environment Canada's daily update feed was unexpectedly discontinued on April 28, 2024.  NOAA/NCEI
is working to implement an alternative approach for updating Canadian station data.

January 13, 2024
GHCNd version 3.31 is released.  Version 3.31 provides a new source and set of stations
provided by the Fiji Met Service.  Specifically, daily rainfall for 25 stations are provided
for the period 1980 to 2022.  This increases the number of stations in GHCNd for the Republic
of Fiji from 5 to 25. Data values provided by the Fiji Met Service are identified using 
the source code (SFLAG) of "f".

March 29, 2023
GHCNd version 3.30 is released.  Version 3.30 changes the prioritization for stations with 
source 'D' (NWS CF6 summaries) and source 'W' (ISD Summary of the Day for NOAA stations).
In v3.30 source 'W' takes precedence over source 'D'.

July 2022
An issue with NCEI IT services prevented updates for GHCNd from July 7 to July 13, 2022.

20 June 2022
On 19 June 2022 version 3.29 of GHCNd was released.  This new version contains additional 
elements for U.S. synoptic/airport stations.  The new elements include daily maximum/minimum/average
relative humidity for the day (RHMX, RHMN, RHAV), average station and sea level pressure (ASTP, ASLP).
average dew point temperature (ADPT) and average wet bulb temperature (AWBT).  Combined, this adds
about 18 million values to GHCNd.  

11 June 2022
Issues with NCEI computing resources have prevented updates to GHCNd since 07 June 2022

16 September 2021
An issue with NCEI computing resources have prevented daily updates to GHCNd for two days.
Daily updates will resume on September 17, 2021, which will include a new ghcnd_all.tar.gz
file. 

23 April 2021
NCEI is experiencing some hardware issues that are preventing daily updates to GHCNd.
Updates will resume as soon as possible and a notification will be posted here as
soon as updates resume.

Febrary 2, 2021
Daily updates were not provided duirng network maintenance at NCEI Asheville on
January 30 and 31.  Daily udpates resumed on Feb. 1.

January 7, 2021
The daily update that initiated at 21 UTC on January 06 2021 failed to complete.
The next update is scheduled for 21 UTC on January 07 2021 and should complete
by 12 UTC on January 8 2021.  Any additional delays will be posted here.  

December 1, 2020
Daily updates for CoCoRaHS station's station's will resume with this evening's update.
These updates were interrupted by an issue with the provider that has now been resolved.

October 13, 2020
Issues with NCEI's ftp services prevented updates and access to GHCNd 
from October 10-13.  Regular updates should resume early on October 14.

November 20, 2019
Internal hardware issues have prevented daily updates to GHCNd since
17 November 2019.  The issue is being addressed and an update is 
expected early on 21 November 2019.

September 30, 2019
There was an error in the ghcnd_all.tar.gz file.  It is being reconstructed
and will be redeployed late today (before 2400 UTC 30 September 2019).


May 15, 2019
On May 16, 2019 GHCNd version 3.27 will be released.  Version 3.27 adds 
the multiday precipitation data elements from the CoCoRaHS Network to
GHCNd.

April 19, 2019
On April 20, 2019 GHCNd version 3.26 will be released. Version 3.26 
contains approximately 5000 new stations for Mexico. The new station data 
are identified with the data source code (SFLAG) 'm' and the total 
number of values in GHCNd will increase by about 150 million with the this
new source of Mexican data.  

March 12, 2019
A new way to transfer daily updates of Canadian station data has been worked
out between Environment Canada and NOAA NCEI.  Daily updates have therefore
resumed for Canadian stations in GHCNd (GHCN-Daily).  The version number 
also increased from 3.24 to 3.25.


January 30, 2019
Due to a technical issue at Environment Canada, daily updates for Canadian 
stations from Environment Canada have not occurred since about 
December 20, 2018.  NOAA NCEI are working with Environment Canada to 
find an alternative way of providing daily updates for Canadian stations.
Note that this issue is unrelated to the U.S. Government shutdown between
Dec. 22, 2018 and January 25, 2019.


December 21, 2018
In the event of a lapse in funding for the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, GHCN-Daily will continue to update automatically 
(subject to the availability of data input sources and 
IT resouces), but will not be monitored by employees. 
We will also be unable to answer questions submitted to any 
of our NOAA email address including ncdc.ghcnd@noaa.gov 
until after government operations resume. 


May 3, 2018
The time that the daily update process begins has been changed from 
00:00 (midnight) Eastern Time (USA) to 14:00 (2 pm) Eastern.

March 30, 2018
A new source is added.  This new source (SFLAG = 'D') provides
short time delay updates of the 'CF6' local climate summaries produced 
by the U.S. National Weather Service for select stations and provided to 
NCEI by the High Plains Regional Climate Center.  Accordingly, the GHCN
Daily version number will be incremented from 3.23 to 3.24.

January 22, 2018
During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Daily will 
continue to update automatically (subject to the availability
of data input sources), but will not be monitored by employees.  
We will also be unable to answer questions submitted to 
ncdc.ghcnd@noaa.gov until after government operations resume. 

January 18, 2018
On January 20, 2018, GHCN-Daily v3.23 will be released.  Version 3.23
has approximately 1000 new European stations added from the 
European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project.

August 23, 2017
Due to some scheduled system maintenance, no update for GHCN-Daily will
occur for August 23.  Updates will resume on August 24.

August 11, 2017
A change in web service protocols at the Western Regional Climate 
Center has caused a temporary cessation of daily updates for 
RAWS stations in GHCN-Daily.  Daily updates should resume within 
the next couple of days.

March 23, 2016.  Updates of daily data for Canadian Stations have
resumed via an update feed provided by Environment Canada.

January 28, 2016.  An interruption in web services at Environment Canada
in early January has prevented updates of daily data for Canadian 
stations in GHCN-Daily.  A new status update will be issued after 
an alternative has been worked out with the Climate Services 
group at Environment Canada.

Effective September 15, 2015, GHCN-Daily version 3.22 will be released.  
Version 3.22 will use a different source of daily SNOTEL data
changing from the Western Regional Climate Center database 
using in versions 3.00 to 3.21 to the one maintained by the USDA/NRCS.
The change to the USDA/NRCS SNOTEL database will also lead to the 
addition of 191 SNOTEL stations, including 60 from Alaska.  

A network outtage at NCEI that began late on September 4, 2015 
prevented daily updates to GHCN-Daily from occurring on 
September 5,6,7 & 8, 2015.  
Daily updates resumed on September 9, 2015

Effective June 23, 2015, GHCN-Daily version 3.21 will be released.  
Version 3.21 will include a new element: TAVG (average daily 
temperature).  When present, TAVG is generally calculated from 
traditional fixed hours of the day or from the fixed synoptic hours
(e.g., 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC).  
In the case of source 'S', hourly values are calculated from the 
fixed synoptic hours or up to 24-hourly values.  
In addition, over 1400 stations are added that 
are part of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional 
Basic Climatology Network.  These newly added stations are updated
using NCEI's Global Summary of the Day dataset (Data Source 'S').  


Effective December 2, 2014, GHCN-Daily version 3.20 will be released
with the following change:
All data from Environment Canada are replaced with a newer version.  
This results in an increase of approximately
2900 stations and the addition of snowfall (SNOW) and snow depth 
(SNWD) for years prior to 2004. In addition, the source code 
(SFLAG) for data provided by Environment Canada is changed 
from 'G' to 'C'.

September 30, 2014
A new flag has been added to the ghcnd-stations.txt list to 
indicate whether a station is part of the U.S. Climate Reference
or U.S. Regional Climate Reference Networks.  See 
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt for 
details

January 10, 2014
An outage on NCDC's ftp server prevented GHCN-Daily updates from
being released on January 9 and 10, 2014. Daily updates are 
expected to resume on January 11, 2014.


October 1, 2013
During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Daily will 
continue to update automatically (subject to the availability
of data input sources), but will not be monitored by 
the GHCN-Daily team.  We will also be unable to answer 
questions submitted to ncdc.ghcnd@noaa.gov until after 
government operations resume. 


Effective September 10, 2013, GHCN-Daily version 3.12 will be released
with the following change:
All European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) data are replaced 
with a new version.  This results in an increase of approximately
2700 stations primarily in Sweden and Finland with some additions
in North Africa and the Middle East.

Effective July 30, 2013, GHCN-Daily version 3.11 will released with 
the following changes to certain U.S. station records:

Effective July 2, 2013
GHCN-Daily version 3.10 will be released with 
the following changes:

1) Updates for most Chinese stations. At the same time, 15 stations that are 
new to GHCN-Daily will be added for China. A new data source code 
(lower case "s") will be introduced to indicate that these updates and 
additions are provided by the China Meteorological Administration/
National Meteorological Information Center/Climatic Data Center.

2) A change in the network identification code for most Chinese stations 
from "0" (unspecified) to "M" (based on the World Meteorological 
Organization identification number). In general, only the third character 
of the GHCN-Daily ID will change (e.g., CH00059316 becomes CHM00059316). 

3) There was a problem where the most recent portion of the record (since 2007)
attributed to the Bjelasnica Observatory (WMO ID=14652) was coming from a 
data source ("S") for the station at Sarajevo (WMO ID=14654).  This has been
fixed in version 3.10.  At the same time, the GHCN-Daily station ID for Bjelasnica 
has been changed from BK000014652 to BKM00014652 and the GHCN-Daily station ID
for Sarajevo has been changed from BKE00100933 to BKM00014654.  

4) Data covering the complete periods of record for RAWS stations have been
re-downloaded from the Western Regional Climate Center to incorporate 
corrections that were made to three stations in North Dakota (USR0000NECO), 
USR0000NHOT, and USR0000NLIM).

Effective 25 June, 2013
GHCN-Daily version 3.03 will be released with 
the following changes:

1) U.S. ASOS/AWOS stations are now updated solely by source "W" (NCDC's Integrated
Surface Data).  The previous realtime update source "A" is no longer used and has 
been removed entirely from GHCN-Daily.  In addition, March 2013 will be the last 
data month for source "X" (DSI-3210); updates previously provided by source "X" 
are now also provide by source "W". 


Effective April 10, 2013: 
1) USW00053921 contains data previously provided under USC00034991.  
GHCN-Daily station ID USC00034991 is discontinued as a separate station.
2) USC00049785 contains data previously provided under USC00041484.  
GHCN-Dail station ID USC00041484 is discontinued as a separate station.
3) Some of the data sources previously provided under USW00014815 are 
now provided under the new GHCN-Daily Station ID USC00200552. 
4) Some of the data sources previously provided under USW00012832 are 
now provided under the new GHCN-Daily Station ID USC00080211. 
5) Some of the data sources previously provided under USW00014819 are 
now provided under the new GHCN-Daily Station ID USC00111577. 


13 March, 2013
Effective March 14, 2013 GHCN-Daily version 3.02 will be released with
the following change:
Daily updates for RAWS will be provided. Updates are dependent upon 
availability in the Western Regional Climate Center's database. 


20 February, 2013
Effective February 26, 2013 GHCN-Daily version 3.01 will be released with
the following change:
Snowdepth values from ECA&D (SFLAG="E") will be 10 times larger than in 
version 3.00. ECA&D provides snowdepth values in cm. The GHCN-Daily system
system now correctly converts the values to mm.

21 December, 2012
Effective December 20, daily updates to SNOTEL data will be provided.
Updates are dependent upon availability in the Western Regional 
Climate Center's database

October 10, 2012
Due to some hardware changes in the processing system, GHCN-Daily 
will now be updated once per day seven days per week via an update 
process that begins at 1 am (0100) Eastern Time everyday. This 
change is effective immediately.

October 9, 2012
Due to a hardware issue, GHCN-Daily updates for Monday, October 8 and
Tuesday October 9, 2012 have been suspended. Additional information  
regarding GHCN-Daily's status will be provided on Wednesday, October 10, 
2012.


Effective September 24, 2012
A new version of GHCN-Daily (v3.00) will be deployed that includes two new
station networks for the U.S.:
(1) The SNOwpack TELemtry (SNOTEL) Network (668 stations)
(2) The Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) Network (1453 permanent
    stations)
    
Data for both networks are obtained from the U.S. Western Regional 
Climate Center. GHCN-Daily IDs for SNOTEL stations are based on the
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) alfanumeric identifiers
and are denoted by the network code "S".  The data source flag for 
SNOTEL data values is 'T'. Elements for SNOTEL stations include
TMAX,TMIN,TOBS,PRCP,WESD.

RAWS station identifiers are denoted by the network code "R".  
The data source flag for RAWS data values is 'U'. Elements for
RAWS stations are limited to TMAX and TMIN.  Since these 
temperatures represent the highest and lowest hourly values for 
the day, they are accompanied by the measurement flag 'H'.


September 14, 2012
The upper bound for the world record temperature exceedance check has
been lowered from the recently invalidated value of 57.8 degrees C to
56.7 degrees C. 
See http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1 for
further details on the investigation.

August 27, 2012
Due to a hardware issue, GHCN-Daily updates for Monday, August 27, 2012 
have been delayed.  Updates are expect to resume on August 28, 2012.

Effective June 25, 2012
A new version of GHCN-Daily (v2.93) will be deployed that includes the
following changes:  

1) Updates for many Russian stations as well as for a few stations 
in some surrounding countries. At the same time, 116 stations that are new 
to GHCN-Daily will be added for the same region. A new data source code 
(lower case "r") will be introduced to indicate that these updates and 
additions are provided by the All-Russian Research Institute of 
Hydrometeorological Information-World Data Center (ARRIHI-WDC).  This new 
data source will lead to an increase of about 17 million daily 
values in the dataset and to about 28 million replacement values 
since the ARRIHI-WDC source will supersede values from other sources for 
existing stations that are being updated by the new ARRIHI-WDC data.  
For the most of the replacements, only the source flag will change. 

2) A change in the network identification code for most Russian stations 
from "0" (unspecified) to "M" (based on the World Meteorological 
Organization identification number). In general, only the third character 
of the GHCN-Daily ID will change (e.g., RS000027612 becomes RSM00027612). 


May 22, 2012
Due to a processing glitch, station files for the the 138 new stations 
added to the ghcnd-stations.txt list on May 18, 2012 are not available.  
Data for these new stations are expected to be available on 
Monday, May 28, 2012.

Effective May 21, 2012
145 Slovenia stations will be removed because they are no longer 
available in the source dataset (SFLAG="E") and 132 newly 
available CoCoRaHS and 6 U.S. Cooperative Observer stations will 
be added.


Effective March 19, 2012:
GHCN-Daily version 2.92 will be available with the following changes:
1) Data source flag (SFLAG) "W" will be added to denote an 
   additional source of data for stations indexed by the WBAN
   station number.
2) Station ID USW00092762 has been corrected to USW00093762.
   Station ID USC00914840 has been changed to PSC00914840.
3) The of stations will increase by 62 with the addition of 
   new Cooperative Network Stations.


Effective January 30, 2012:
GHCN-Daily version 2.91 will be available with the following changes:
1) Data source flag (SFLAG) "Z" will be added to denote official 
   data additions and replacements associated with the Datzilla 
   data error tracking system.  Version 2.91 includes Datzilla values
   for ASOS stations including temperature, precipitation and snowfall,
   and snowdepths edits for 2011 and approximately 200000 snowfall and 
   snowdepth values submitted by Weather Forecast Offices for years 
   prior to 2011. 
2) The number of station will increase by 268 with the addition of 
   newly available CoCoRaHS stations.  The total number of stations
   is now 80615. 


Effective December 5, 2011:

The number of GHCN-Daily stations will increase to 80347 with the 
addition of over 1400 CoCoRaHS network stations.


The release of GHCN-Daily version 2.90 is planned for Monday, 
November 21, 2011.  Version 2.90 includes the following changes:

1) About 1270 new stations will be added from the European Climate 
   Assessment Dataset (ECA&D).  At the same time, approximately 450 
   stations already in GHCN-Daily will receive updates and/or edits 
   from the ECA source (data source flag [SFLAG] = "E").  The 
   additions and updates will increase the number of values in 
   GHCN-Daily by approximately 50 million (50000000), and the source 
   flag for a number of existing values will change from "S", "I",
   or "G" to "E" to reflect the addition of the new ECA source. The
   earliest year in the dataset will change from 1832 to 1763.

   ECA data are described in Klein Tank, A.M.G. and Coauthors (2002): 
   Daily dataset of 20th-century surface air temperature and 
   precipitation series for the European Climate Assessment. Int. J. 
   of Climatol., 22, 1441-1453.  Data and metadata available at 
   http://eca.knmi.nl).

2) The station identifier "SI000000192" (LJUBLJANA BEZIGRAD) will change
   to "SIM00014015".  

November 3, 2011

The latitude for station USC00325848 has been corrected.
The correct latitude is 48.0781, but was reported erroreously 
as 46.0781.

Effective September 15, 2011

1) NCDC DSI 3207 data (WxCoder3) are added for July 2011 (SFLAG="7")

2) U.S. Cooperative Summary of the Day data digitized from paper 
   observer forms between September 7 and September 14, 2011 are 
   added (SFLAG="K") 


Effective Monday September 12, 2011
 1) DSI 3200 is given priority over DSI 3206
 
 2) The measurement flag "P" is added for values identified as 
 "missing presumed zero" in DSI 3200 and 3206.  This flag was set
 in DSI 3200 and 3206 when no value was indicated by the observer.
 Affected are more than 100 million PRCP, SNOW, or SNWD values.  
 Particularly for data before 1982, it appears that the absence 
 of the "missing presumed zero flag" does not necessarily imply 
 that the value was originally recorded as zero.

Effective June 13, 2011:
 1) Data source "K" (U.S. Cooperative Observer Summary of the Day data
    digitized from paper forms) will be added. Weather types, soil
    temperatures, water equivalent of snow depth from source "K" 
    are forthcoming.
    
    Beginning in 2011, U.S. Cooperative Observer data is comprised 
    of sources "7" and "K" and "H". The last year for DSI-3200 is 
    2010, with sources "7" and "K" being a direct continuation of 
    DSI 3200.  Source "H" provides real time updates. 
    
 2) Elements PRCP, SNOW and SNWD from source "M" will be removed.
    Daily precipitation totals from this source were too small.
    

Effective May 23, 2011 data source "2" (preliminary keyed data for U.S.
Cooperative Observer stations) has been removed. Note that data source 2 
at some stations was attributed to the wrong calendar month.   

Effective May 16, 2011:

GHCN-Daily version 2.70 will be replace by version 2.80.  This includes 
the following changes:

1) The records for approximately 800 U.S. stations are now indexed using
   network code "W" instead of network code "C".  For example, data for
   ASHEVILLE AP are stored under GHCN-Daily USW00003812 instread of 
   USC00310300.

2) Reidentified the data sources for all U.S. stations to reflect changes
   in the indexing of stations in the source datasets 
   
3) Data from source "1" has been replace by source "7" (DSI-3207-WxCoder3).  

4) The file "ghcnd-us-states.txt" has been replaced with "ghcnd-states.txt"
   and now also includes codes for Canadian provinces

Effective February 14, 2011 

1) 31 new elements will be added from DSI 3210.  See the readme.txt file
for element definitions.
2) The element for water equivalent of snow on the ground has changed
from "WTEQ" to "WESD" to be consistent with the element "WESF".
3) A fix will be implemented to take into account an undocumented
way in which multiday totals are reported in DSI 3200. The fix 
corrects the number of days in multiday sums after the year 2004
at U.S. stations
4) The number of stations will increase by 12 from 76671 to 76683 with
the addition of new U.S. Cooperative Observer Stations.

21 January 2011

Effective January 24, 2011, the number of GHCN-Daily stations will 
increase by 325 to a total 76671 with the addition of new U.S. Cooperative
Observer and CoCoRaHS stations.  

17 December 2010

Effective December 20, 2010, the number of GHCN Daily stations will 
increase by 36 to a total 76346 with the addition of new U.S. Cooperative
Observer stations.  In addition, the following station ids were changed
to reflect the correct FIPS country codes:

USC00668814 changed to RQC00668814
USC00670820 changed to VQC00670820
USC00671316 changed to VQC00671316
USC00671348 changed to VQC00671348
USC00671790 changed to VQC00671790
USC00671980 changed to VQC00671980
USC00672551 changed to VQC00672551
USC00674820 changed to VQC00674820
USC00679222 changed to VQC00679222

10 December 2010

Effective December 13, 2010, GHCN Daily version 2.60 will be
released with the following changes:

the addition of elements 'DAEV', 'DASF' and 'DAWM' (Number of days in 
multiday evaporation, snowfall, and wind movement).  

The element 'DAPR', previously only available for 
Australia, will also be provided for U.S. stations.  These elements
will be flagged with QFLAG='L' when the length of a multiday period
is less than 2 days or greater than 31 days, or when a single day 
observation is present during the interval covered by a 
corresponding multiday element. 

15 October 2010

Effective October 25, 2010 the number of stations in GHCN Daily will 
increase by 903 to a total of 76142 with the addition of 
newly available CoCoRaHS stations and updates for Ukraine (SFLAG='u'), 
Uzbekistan (SFLAG='z'), and Belarus (SFLAG='b').  

17 September 2010

1. Data from approximately 17000 Australian stations will be added on 
20 September 2010.  These data, supplied by the Australian Bureau
of Meteorology, replace any previous data for Australian stations
and will be updated monthly.  The new total number of stations in 
GHCN Daily is 75239.

2. A set of new elements have been created to represent values 
pertaining to multiday observational periods (e.g., MDPR = 
precipitation accumulated over more than one day).  Multiday
values previously identified with an "A" QFLAG are now identified
using the new multiday element codes instead.  See the element list
in the readme.txt file for definitions of the new element codes.

13 August 2010

1. The locations, names, and WMO numbers of active U.S. stations in the 
GHCN-Daily station list (ghcnd-stations.txt) have been updated to agree 
with the latest information available in NCDC's Master Station History Record.

2. Effective 16 August 2010, data for 37 newly opened U.S. Cooperative 
Network stations will be part of GHCN-Daily, bringing the total number 
of stations to 58221.


09 July 2010

Effective 12 July 2010, data from the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow (CoCoRaHS) Network
will be added to GHCN Daily.  This additional source will increase the number of stations from 
44010 to 58184.  This new source also provides a element new to GHCN Daily: Water Equivalent of 
SnowFall (WEFS).  The source flag (SFLAG) for CoCoRaHS is "N". 


16 June 2010

As of June 21, 2010 daily precipiation from source "G" have been removed 
until uncertainty about the units is resolved. Note that many of the values 
were an order of magnitude too small.  Some of the removed totals from 
the 'G' source are replaced by sources 'I' and 'S'.


04 June 2010

The number of stations in GHCN Daily has increased by 89 with the addition of
newly assigned U.S. Cooperative Observer Network stations.  The total number of
stations is now 44 010.  Data files for these new stations will be available
June 07, 2010.

The longitudes for the following stations were corrected by adding a negative
sign.

USC00023096 
USC00053010 
USC00189674 
USC00300958 
USC00413270 

The id for RQC00670260  was changed VQC00670260.

13 April 2010

The temperature at observation time (element code TOBS) is now included in 
the real-time updates received from the High Plains Regional Climate 
Center (source code H) beginning in early April 2010. As a result, TOBS 
is now being updated in real time at many GHCN-Daily stations where it 
was not updated previously.

6 April 2010

The following two issues affecting precipitation totals in GHCN-Daily have
been brought to our attention:

1. At stations in the United Kingdom and France, precipitation totals with a
data source flag of "G" appear to be in units of millimeters rather than
tenths of millimeters. We are investigating this problem and will update 
this status file when the problem has been rectified.

2. The mingling of daily and multi-day precipitation totals from multiple
sources seems to have created some instances in which the same precipitation
event appears on consecutive days in GHCN-Daily. This issue will be addressed
sometime in the coming months. In the meantime, users interested in processing
multi-day precipitation accumulations identified with a quality-control flag
of "A" are advised to set such accumulated totals to missing if they are 
preceded by a nonmissing value on the preceding day.

12 February 2010

The following changes were made according to research performed by the  
NCDC metadata team on DSI 3206:

Station data for USC00094203 has now been merged with station USC00094204
Station data for USC00170488 has now been merged with station USC00170480
Station data for USC00245054 has now been merged with station USC00245045

There are now 43921 stations in GHCN Daily.


05 February 2010

Historical data from several African countries will be added on 
08 February 2010.  A number of newly available U.S.Cooperative 
Observer stations will also be added at this time bringing the 
total number of GHCN Daily stations to 43924.

18 December 2009

A file that specifies the current version of GHCN Daily (i.e. time stamp of 
last processing) is now provided in the ftp directory and all tar.gz files.
The name of the version control file is "ghcnd-version.txt".


23 November 2009

Version 2.1 was place online with the following changes:

The number of stations in ghcn daily increased from 43630 to 43713 with the 
addition of newly opened U.S. Cooperative Observer stations.

The following elements have been added for U.S. stations:
Pan Evaporation, Max and Min Pan Temperature, Max and Min Soil 
Temperatures at various depths, Water Equivalent of Snow on the 
Ground, Weather Types, and 24 Wind Movement.  See the "readme.txt"
for corresponding element codes and quality flags.  

June 05, 2009
The number of stations in ghcn daily will increase by 137 to 43630 on
June 08, 2009 with the addition of NOAA Climate Reference Network and
U.S. Historical Climatology Network-Modernized stations.

April 10, 2009
The of number of stations in ghcn-daily will increase by 2 to 43493 on
April 13, 2009.


April 03, 2009
Begining April 6, the following changes will take place:
  - QFLAG "F" becomes "N"
  - QFLAG "T" becomes "X" (for SNWD only)
  - The number of "K" QFLAGs for TMAX, TMIN, TOBS, and PRCP is reduced due to an
    increase in the streak check threshold to 20 for all four variables
  - A new measurement flag (MFLAG="L") is added for temperature to identify
    months in which temperatues appear to be lagged (out of phase) with the 
    reported observation time.

February 18, 2009
Added the "Spatial Regression" check, which flags maximum and minimum temperature 
values that are spatial outliers.  This addition increases the number of 
temperature values flagged as spatial outliers (QFLAG = "S"). 

December 17, 2008
U.S. Forts data have been added as a data source and will appear in station files
on December 22, 2008.  The number of stations is now 43491.
The GSN designations for stations in Canada have also been updated.  There are now
886 GSN stations in the /gsn directory.

November 7, 2008
Removed four stations from ghcnd-stations.txt for which no data were available.

August 18, 2008
Added the temperature at the time of observation denoted as TOBS as a sixth element
The previous temperature internal consistency and three-day consistency checks 
(QFLAG = "I" or "C") have been replaced with an integrated consistency check among 
elements TMAX, TMIN, and TOBS (QFLAG = "I").  This new check flags a considerably 
larger number of temperature values.  The element TOBS and the new check will be added
to data for 2008 beginning August 18 and to other years on August 25, 2008.


June 24, 2008
The processing problem affecting "O" quality flags for Canadian snowfall 
and snow depth observations has been fixed. "O" flags for these observations can now 
be treated like all other quality flags.

June 16, 2008
Because of an error in processing snowfall and snow depth users should
ignore any "O" quality flags for elements "SNOW" and "SNWD" at Canadian
stations.


June 7, 2008
Added Preliminary (Transmitted and Keyed) Cooperative Summary of the Day Data
(Data Source Flags equal 1 and 2, respectively), which increases the number of 
stations by 128 to 43 490

May 30, 2008:
A new GHCN-Daily system has now been deployed.  Please note the following:
  1. The first 3 characters of the station identification code have changed from
  the 3 digit country code to a two-character FIPS country code plus a network
  code.  
  2. The format of the station inventory has changed.
  3. The number of stations has increased to more than 43 000
  4. The elements SNOW (snowfall) and SNWD (snow depth) were added.
  
  See the readme.txt for details
 
May 19, 2008:
Please note that a new version of GHCN-Daily will be deployed the week of 19 May
2008.  Data files will not be available for a few days prior to deployment.

May 6, 2008:
Due to a processing problem, historical data for the U.S. are currently not
available.  We expect the problem to be fixed within a few days.

May 1, 2007:
Changed the threshold for the temperature GAP check from 11.81 to the intended 10.0 Deg C.  

April 28, 2007:
Fixed data source merging process to include updated official GCOS data (i.e., values with data source flag "G").

December 21, 2006:
Version 2.0 of GHCN Daily was placed online in this FTP directory.
