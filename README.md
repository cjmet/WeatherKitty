## To-Do

- [ ] Weather Kitty - To-Do List

  - [ ] manual geolocation by zipcode if geolocation is not available.
  - [ ] refactor main weatherkitty api calls to update to better async await and error handling. Maybe use functions and stacks, instead of linear without the best failure logic.
  - [ ] refactor the globals for cleaner code.

- [ ] Project - To-Do List
  - [ ] Auth / OAuth API
  - [ ] AWS, Lambda, Hosting, Etc, ...
  - [ ] Look into Vue

## CodeKy Project Requirements

- [ ] **Required**

  - [x] GitHub Repository: Upload your project to GitHub with a minimum of 5 distinct commits. Uploading via Git command line is required; GitHub's file uploader won't suffice.
  - [x] README File: Include a README file explaining your project.
        Describe your project in a paragraph or more.
  - [ ] Visual Appeal: Design your project to be visually appealing; follow industry trends.
  - [x] Responsive Design: Implement responsive design using media queries, CSS Grid, Flexbox, etc. Your application should adapt to at least two screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
  - [x] 3+ features from the provided list that you've integrated. Add any special instructions for the reviewer to run your project.
  - [x] Add a 4th feature
  - [x] API: Integrate a third-party API into your project.
    - [x] Read API **or** Write to an API
          &nbsp;

- [x] **Features (Choose 2)**

  - [x] Use Arrays, Objects, Sets, or Maps
  - [x] Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
  - [ ] Use a regular expression to validate user input optionally inform the user about it.
  - [x] Analyze text and display useful information about it. (e.g. word/character count in an input field)
  - [x] Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs. Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc).
  - [x] Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)
  - [ ] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
  - [x] Convert ~~user~~ input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc)
  - [ ] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
        &nbsp;

- [x] **Advanced Features (Choose 1)**

  - [x] Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
  - [ ] Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc).
  - [ ] Persist data to an external API and make the stored data accessible in your app (including after reload/refresh).
        &nbsp;

- [ ] **Optional Features (Swap with Section 1)**
  - [ ] Create a node.js web server using a modern framework such as **Express.js** or **Fastify**. Serve at least one route that your app uses (must serve more than just the index.html file).
  - [ ] Interact with a database to store and retrieve information (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, etc).
  - [ ] Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc).
  - [ ] Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.

- Converting to module and html elements and trying to make everything more portable, usable, and compatible.

## 24/09/10

- Converting to module and html elements and trying to make everything more portable, usable, and compatible.

## 24/09/01

- VSCode.LiveServer.Https issues. Reinstalling the **_Visual Studio IDE_** API Certificates re-enabled https. So it at least appears the IDE certificate expiring may have been the issue.
- Added the custom html block option

## 24/08/30

- Refactored using concrete images for the transparent background. Both ways can work, but I decided I liked this way better.

  ```

  #Container {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
  }

  .WeatherKittyBackgroundImg {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    object-position: center;
    opacity: 0.8;
    z-index: -1;
  }
  ```

### 24/08/29

- Refactoring WeatherKitty to be portable
- More portability changes ... rems to ems so we can override in the client/parent
- :before transparency version did not work, try again with container -> relative
- The following should work for :before

  ```
  #Container {
      position: relative;
      display: flex;
  }
  #Container::before {
      content: "";
      display: block;
      position: absolute;
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
      opacity: 0.8;
      background-image: url("CatGirlReading.jpeg");
      background-size: cover;
      background-position: center;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      z-index: -1;
  }
  ```

- Here is the concrete image implementation that does work.

  ```

  #Container {
      position: relative;
      display: flex;
  }

  #TextWrapper {
      flex-grow: 1;
      position: relative;
  }

  #Image {
      flex-grow: 1;
      position: absolute;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
      object-position: center;
      opacity: 0.75;
  }

  ```
